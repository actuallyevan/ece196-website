        <h1>Update 1 - Week 7 Monday (& Prior)</h1>

        <p>
          During the first portion of the class, our efforts were mainly focused
          on finding a problem to solve and later brainstorming ideas for a
          solution. After finding our problem, we quickly came up with the idea
          of an indoor environmental monitor. Shortly after, we chose parts and
          began to design our PCB.
        </p>

        <h2>Choosing parts</h2>
        <p>
          Choosing multiple sensors and ensuring compability was a bit of
          challenge in regards to the pin budget of the esp32 breakout board. We
          ended up going with sensors + esp32 board from Adafruit for ease of
          ordering, compability, and documentation. To organize our materials
          and ensure compatability, we created
          <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131sWxI_M1ms29DY5qt7oAHl-zEb3N0CwOz0BO7ZT33k/edit?usp=sharing"
            style="color: lightblue"
            >this google sheet.</a
          >
        </p>

        <h2>PCB Design</h2>
        <p>
          Choosing parts was honestly more challenging than designing the PCB.
          Because we are only using breakout boards, PCB design was relatively
          straightfoward. Other than routing, the main challenge was power
          budget. Because we are using both the 2.2" TFT LCD Display and the
          Adafruit PMSA003I, connecting everything on the onboard 3.3v regulator
          would overload it. This necessitated the use of an external 5 -> 3.3v
          LDO to create a second 3.3v rail. One additional note was that we had to 
          create our own custom symbols + footprints for the breakout boards by converting
          the Adafruit Eagle files to KiCAD and extracting the edge cuts/reading the pinout.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, we are still waiting for our parts to arrive. Currently, we
          are in the process of researching various libraries that we can use to
          interface with the sensors and display in addition to setting up a git
          repository for our project. The content of the timeline has been
          "compressed" from week 5-9 to week 7-9. If we get the parts this week,
          should have the sensors tested + PCB assembled by the end of the week.
