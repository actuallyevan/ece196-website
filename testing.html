        <h1>Testing</h1>

        <p>
          In addition to tests performed in our video demo, below are graphs of various
          tests we did on our system to assess its accuracy and
          usefulness. Beneath those graphs are short explanations
          of the data. Additionally, there are some photos taken during each
          test. Further down the page, the algorithm that we use to generate the
          overall environmental score is explained.

          The first graph contains the reference (thermostat) and the measured
          (from our monitor) temperature and humidity. As shown, the measured
          temperature starts slightly lower than the reference, but then
          stabilizes and remains quite close to the reference temperature. The
          measured humidity is slightly lower than the reference, but it is
          still within margin of error.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second graph shows the gradual return of CO2 levels to normal
          after a brief burst of high CO2. As shown, the initial CO2 level is
          around 650 ppm, which is considered normal indoors. After a burst of
          high CO2, the levels rise to around 2500 ppm, but then gradually
          return to normal levels within a few minutes. This is a synthetic
          test, but it demonstrates the system's ability to measure CO2
          accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third graph displays the reference (iPhone) and measured (from our
          monitor) sound intensity in dB. For lower decibel levels, the
          reference aligns closely with the measured sound intensity, but
          our monitor tends to overestimate the sound intensity at higher levels
          >60 dB. However, this may have been due to the exact position of the
          computer (noise source) relative to the phone and our monitor. When
          directly above both the phone and our monitor, we were able to measure
          70 dB on both devices (shown in manual decibel test image).

        <h1 class="section-divider">Score Algorithm</h1>

        <p>
          Our monitor uses a simple but effective algorithm to generate an
          overall comfort score based on AQI (PM2.5), CO2, noise, temperature,
          and humidity. This score is designed to provide a safety oriented
          measure of the environment (for example, a harmful CO2 level >2000 ppm
          would result in a score of 0).
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a separate value that determines specifically whether the
          conditions are good for study (displayed on a different screen). This
          value (which is boolean/good or bad) is determined with similar
          thresholds as below (with below approx. the lowest threshold being good),
          except the noise level is required to be below 45 dB.
        </p>

        <p>
          When creating the algorithm, we used multiple sources to help us
          determine the various thresholds for each measurement (sources are in
          references). There is not an overall AQI-like measurement that
          includes noise (and the other measurements), so we needed to start
          from scratch using our sources as a guideline.
        </p>

        <p>
          The comfort score, ranging from 0 to 100, is calculated by starting at
          100 and applying penalties based on several environmental
          measurements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><strong>PM2.5:</strong></b>
            <ul>
              <li>≤15 µg/m³: No penalty.</li>
              <li>>15 to ≤35 µg/m³: 5 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>35 to ≤75 µg/m³: 15 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>75 to ≤150 µg/m³: 70 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>150 µg/m³: 100 points deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><strong>CO2:</strong></b>
            <ul>
              <li>≤800 ppm: No penalty.</li>
              <li>>800 to ≤1200 ppm: 15 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>1200 to ≤1500 ppm: 30 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>1500 to ≤2000 ppm: 60 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>2000 ppm: 100 points deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><strong>Noise:</strong></b>
            <ul>
              <li>≤35 dB: No penalty.</li>
              <li>>35 to ≤45 dB: 5 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>45 to ≤60 dB: 15 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>60 to ≤80 dB: 30 points deduction.</li>
              <li>>80 dB: 40 points deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><strong>Temperature:</strong></b>
            <ul>
              <li>65°F to 80°F: No penalty.</li>
              <li>60°F to <65°F or >80°F to 85°F: 10 points deduction.</li>
              <li>55°F to <60°F or >85°F to 90°F: 20 points deduction.</li>
              <li>50°F to <55°F or >90°F to 95°F: 40 points deduction.</li>
              <li><50°F or >95°F: 65 points deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><strong>Humidity:</strong></b>
            <ul>
              <li>25% to 75%: No penalty.</li>
              <li>15% to <25% or >75% to 85%: 10 points deduction.</li>
              <li><15% or >85%: 30 points deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After these deductions, if the score is below 80, it is increased by
          20% (multiplied by 1.2). The final score is then constrained between 0
          and 100. Higher scores, achieved by maintaining optimal levels across
          these measurements, indicate a healthy and comfortable indoor
          environment.
