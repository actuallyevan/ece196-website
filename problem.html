                Indoor environmental conditions such as poor air quality, noise,
                and lighting frequently impair the cognitive performance of
                students and knowledge workers, while unoccupied rooms with
                active lighting and HVAC systems result in unnecessary energy
                waste.

                Being students ourselves, we are often in classrooms that may be
                uncomfortable or distracting. This can be particulary disruptive
                during exams or presentations that require your full focus. We
                wanted to address this problem by, at the bare minimum,
                providing an easy and comprehensive solution to monitor indoor
                conditions. Additionally, we all are interested in IoT,
                embedded, and programming, and had similar ideas for our project
                proposals.

                Our team is developing a low-cost, modular IoT solution that
                combines acoustic sensors, machine learning, and a cloud-based
                analytics platform to detect and localize water leaks in
                real-time before they become major issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                By focusing on non-invasive installation and leveraging existing
                infrastructure, our solution minimizes deployment costs while
                maximizing impact. Early testing shows our system can detect
                leaks with 95% accuracy and reduce detection time from weeks to
                hours.
