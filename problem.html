                Indoor environmental conditions such as poor air quality, noise,
                and lighting frequently impair the cognitive performance of
                students and knowledge workers. Often, these poor conditions go
                unnoticed, causing lasting effects on productivity (and health).
              </p>
              <p>
                Being students ourselves, we are often in classrooms that may be
                uncomfortable or distracting. This can be particulary disruptive
                during exams or presentations that require your full focus. We
                wanted to address this problem by, at the bare minimum,
                providing an easy and comprehensive solution to monitor indoor
                conditions. Additionally, we all are interested in IoT,
                embedded, and programming, and had similar ideas for our project
                proposals.

                One of the most prominent existing solutions is the
                <strong>Awair Element/Omni</strong>, which measure:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Temperature</li>
                <li>Humidity</li>
                <li>CO2 levels</li>
                <li>TVOC levels</li>
                <li>PM2.5 levels</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, these solutions are quite expensive, with the Element
                version costing over $200.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another solution is the <strong>uHoo Smart Air Monitor</strong>,
                which offers similar features to the Awair Element/Omni, but is
                even more expensive than the Awair Element at $300. There are
                many other consumer and business solutions similiar to these two
                products, but they are typically quite expensive which may make
                them unfeasible for public facilities (schools) or small
                businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to these existing solutions, there have been some
                proposed solutions that are arguably more compelling because of
                their affordability. One such solution is VentQsys, detailed in
                <a
                  href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-021-02799-5"
                  style="color: lightblue"
                  >this paper</a
                >. Of course, this is only a theoretical solution, but it seems
                to address some of the problems that we are also trying to
                solve.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, there are multiple existing and comprehensive
                solutions, but they are all very expensive, which may be
                responsible for the low adoption in classrooms or public spaces.
