        <h1>Update 3 - Week 9 Monday</h1>

        <p>
          Week 8 was a productive week for our team. We assembled the PCB and were able to connect and 
          read all of the sensor data simultaneously. Additionally, we designed and printed the 
          enclosure for the indoor monitor.
        </p>

        <h2>PCB Assembly</h2>
        <p>
          As soon as we received our PCB, we soldered the header pins and other components onto it. After that,
          we combined our code that we used to test the sensors individually and were able to read data from all sensors at once.
        </p>

        <h2>Enclosure 3D Printing</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we had the PCB and all of the sensors connected to it, we were were able to measure the dimensions
          of the entire system and design an enclosure using OnShape.
        </p>

        <h2>Further Software Development</h2>
        <p>
          After successfully reading data from all of the sensors, we began focusing solely on the user experience
          and how the data will be displayed to the user. This entails how the data will be displayed on the screen,
          how many pages there are, and how we can make it easy for the user to interpret the data. We were able 
          to create a simple page layout by the end of the week.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Designing and 3D printing the enclosure was challenging and took longer than expected. Because of the sandwich
          design of the enclosure, the dimensions/tolerances of the friction fit needed to be precise. The initial 
          print was too tight, so we had to adjust the dimensions and re-print. Luckily, the second print 
          had a good friction fit (with some tape to adjust). However, the process took a long time and was 
          a little frustrating due to the minimal availbility of 3D printers.
