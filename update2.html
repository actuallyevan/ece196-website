        <h1>Update 2 - Week 8 Monday</h1>

        <p>
          Because we received our parts, we were able to make major progress on
          our project during week 7. However, we have not yet received our PCB,
          so we were unable to test all of the components together (due to power
          budget issues).
        </p>

        <h2>Testing breakouts</h2>
        <p>
          The first step was testing all of the breakout boards. To achieve
          this, we breadboarded the circuit referencing the google sheet that we
          created in the last milestone. Using the example code by Adafruit, we
          were able to confirm most of the breakouts were working after soldering
          header pins to them and breadboarding the circuit, but we ran into some
          challenges detailed below.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to testing individual components, we also started
          programming to enable multiple sensors to work together using I2S,
          I2C, and SPI. Although we couldn't test every component together, we
          were able to read data from multiple I2S sensors (BME680, SCD-40).
          Additionally, we tested the display with test data.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Setting up I2S for the MEMS microphone was a bit tricky, but by
          following the Adafruit example code and using the oscilloscope to make
          sure the clock signals were correct, we were able to successfully
          measure loudness to some extent.
        </p>

        <p>
          When trying to test the SCD-40 with other sensors on the breadboard, it was not being detected, 
          which was concerning. However, once we got our PCB (in later week), all the sensors worked together as expected.
          We think this may have been possibly due to power budget issues on the breadboard that our PCB was
          designed to solve.
